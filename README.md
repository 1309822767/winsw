Maven Packaging for [Windows Service Wrapper](https://github.com/kohsuke/winsw)
===========================================

This repository represents the legacy packaging of [Windows Service Wrapper](https://github.com/kohsuke/winsw) as a Maven artifact
which is hosted in the [Jenkins Artifactory](https://repo.jenkins-ci.org).
New versions of the project use GitHub Releases and NuGet, but some Pipelines including Jenkins still use Maven as a download source.

New releases of the Maven packaging will be performed upon request.
